Sleep is an essential function that is necessary for our overall health and well-being. On top of allowing our bodies time to rest and heal, sleep is important to a number of brain functions, including how nerve cells communicate with each other. However, it is estimated that 25-30% of adults do not get enough sleep. Lack of sleep is linked to a number of health conditions, including increases in body weight and cardiovascular disease risk, and poorer mental health.

Recent research suggests that psychotherapy interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness may be more effective at treating insomnia, in comparison to use of sleep medications. Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in which a person has trouble falling and/or staying asleep. For today's tutorial, imagine you are working with a psychology professor who wants to examine the effect of psychotherapy interventions on insomnia. You recruit 200 patients with insomnia from a sleep clinic, and randomize them equally into 4 treatment groups: 1) a control group (no treatment), 2) cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), 3) mindfulness, and 4) sleep medication. After 6 weeks of treatment, sleep duration (i.e. the number of hours you sleep in one night) was measured for all participants.

This week you will work with simulated data from this experiment. Imagine you are asked to analyze the data from this experiment, and decide which treatment is the most effective. Using a one-way ANOVA, you will investigate whether different types of treatments can improve sleep duration in patients with insomnia.
