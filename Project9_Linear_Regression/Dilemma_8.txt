Dilemma_9
Women are consistently underrepresented in legislatures across the globe, despite the fact that there are more women than ever running for political office. In 2017, the total female population was approximately 50 percent, yet women make up 23 percent of the world’s national parliaments. The causes for women’s underrepresentation in legislatures across the globe is well documented; there are both institutional and cultural factors that lead to lower rates of women candidates.

Institutional factors like electoral systems significantly impact the number of women elected to legislatures. For example, proportional representation electoral systems are more likely to promote and elect women candidates compared to first-past-the-post electoral systems. Similarly, while more women candidates are running for office now than ever, they are often put in “failed” or “doomed” ridings, meaning that the party knows they won’t actually win in that riding but they can say they have more women candidates running for them. Culturally, women politicians are treated differently than their male-counterparts. Scholars often cite media sexism one of the most significant cultural barrier for women’s equal political representation.
